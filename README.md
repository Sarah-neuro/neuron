# LIF Neuron Simulation

This repository consists of simulations of a **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model** using Python. This project was developed as part of my early exploration into computational neuroscience and the code explores the neuron's spiking behavior under both deterministic and noisy inputs.

## Contents
- Definition of LIF neuron dynamics
- Injection of DC and Gaussian white noise (GWN) current
- Spike detection and ISI (Inter-Spike Interval) analysis
- Visualization of:
  - Firing rate vs input current (F-I curves)
  - Spike time irregularity (CV-ISI)
  - Heatmaps over parameter space

##  How to Use
Run the `LIF_Neuron_Model.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
No additional setup is required other than basic Python libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`).
